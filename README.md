# SQL Data Analytics Project: Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world retail company's database. As a Data Analyst, you will analyze sales, customers, and product data to gain business insights. The database consists of multiple interconnected tables, allowing for the practice of SQL joins, filtering, grouping, ordering, aggregations, and unions.

## Database Schema

The project includes the following tables:

1. **Customers** - Stores customer details.
2. **Products** - Stores product details.
3. **Orders** - Stores order details.
4. **Order_Items** - Stores each product within an order.
5. **Payments** - Stores payment details.
6. **Employees** - Stores employee details who process orders.

Each table has a well-defined schema with relevant constraints like primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

## Sample Data

The database is populated with at least 15 rows per table. This ensures sufficient data for analysis using:

- `LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`
- `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`

## Analysis Tasks

The following SQL queries will be used to analyze the dataset:

1. Find the total number of orders for each customer.
2. Identify customers who placed orders but have not made payments.
3. Retrieve the top 5 highest revenue-generating products.
4. Show the total revenue generated by each category.
5. Find the employees who do not have a manager assigned.
6. List all products that have never been ordered.
7. Identify customers who have placed more than 3 orders.
8. Find the employee with the highest salary.
9. Retrieve a list of all customers and employees together in one column.
10. Get the second highest order total amount.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a hands-on opportunity to apply SQL skills in a real-world retail scenario. By performing various data manipulations and queries, you gain insights into customer behavior, product sales, and employee performance.
